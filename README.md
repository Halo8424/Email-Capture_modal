# Email-Capture_modal

## Overview
The e-mail capture modal activates when a user tries to leaves the main document screen. The modal consists of two simple columns where one provides a short description and an input field to capture the e-mail, the other provides an image related to your business. On a successful e-mail capture, a "Thank-You" message is displayed to the user.
